**Course Description:**  

Topics include a study of sample spaces, counting rules, conditional probability and independence, random
variables and their properties, moment generating functions, named distributions, both discrete and continuous,
transformations, the Central Limit Theorem, covariance and correlation coefficients, order statistics, and
multivariate probability distributions. 

Prerequisite: MAT 2130

**Course Objectives:**

1.  *General Probability* : The Student will understand basic probability concepts.
2.  *Univariate Random Variables* : The Student will understand key concepts concerning discrete and
continuous univariate random variables (including binomial, negative binomial, geometric,
hypergeometric, Poisson, uniform, exponential, gamma, normal, and mixed) and their applications.
3. *Multivariate Random Variables* : The Student will understand key concepts concerning multivariate random
variables (including the bivariate normal) and their applications.


**Learning Outcomes**

The Student will be able to:


**I. General Probability**

*  Define set functions, sample space, and events. Define probability as a set function on a collection of events
and state the basic axioms of probability.


*  Calculate probabilities of mutually exclusive events.

*  Calculate probabilities using the addition and multiplication rules.

*   Define independence and calculate probability of independent events.

*   Calculate probabilities using combinatorics, such as combinations and permutations.

*   Define and calculate conditional probabilities.

*   State Bayes Theorem and use it to calculate conditional probabilities.


**II. Univariate Random Variables**

*   Explain and apply the concepts of random variables, probability and probability density functions,
cumulative distribution functions.

*   Calculate conditional probabilities.

*   Explain and calculate expected value, mode, median, percentile, and higher moments.

*   Explain and calculate variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.

*   Define probability generating functions and moment generating functions and use them to calculate
probabilities and moments.

*   Determine the sum of independent random variables (Poisson and normal).

*   Apply transformations.


**III. Multivariate Random Variables**

*  Explain and perform calculations concerning joint probability and probability density functions and
cumulative distribution functions.

*   Determine conditional and marginal probability and probability density functions, cumulative distribution
functions.

*   Calculate moments for joint, conditional, and marginal random variables.

* Explain and apply joint moment generating functions.

* Calculate variance and standard deviation for conditional and marginal probability distributions.

* Calculate joint moments, such as the covariance and the correlation coefficient.

* Determine the distribution of a transformation of jointly distributed random variables. 

* Determine the distribution of order statistics from a set of independent random variables.

* Calculate probabilities and moments for linear combinations of independent random variables.

* State and apply the Central Limit Theorem.

**Required Resources:**

Note book, notes,  pencil and  a calculator.

As we are trying to make this experience as close to a regular class as possible, interactivity is important. Therefore you are required to have your \textbf{video} \textbf{camera} \textbf{on} and actively participate in all the class discussions. 

 **Homework:** Students are expected to work all assigned problems. Only selected assignments or parts of
assignments may at times be graded. 

**Quizzes:** I anticipate giving in class quizzes regularly during the semester. As the final quizzes need to be proctored you are required to have your video camera on during quiz time.
<!--The lowest quiz grade will be
dropped when determining the final grade.-->

**Tests:** Two tests will be given. The date of each test will be announced at least one week in advance. As the exams need to be proctored you are required to have your video camera on during the exam time.


**Final Exam:** A final exam will be given at our assigned time. This final exam will be comprehensive, covering all
material that is covered in the course. As the final exam needs to be proctored you are required to have your video camera on during the  final exam time.


**Attendance:** Attendance will be taken  at the end of each class. Students are expected to attend every class. A detailed description of the ASU attendance policy can be found at the following link,
[https://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi-policy-and-statement-information]

**Course Grading:**

* 10% of the grade will come from Homework.
* 20% of the course grade will come from Quizzes.
* 40% of the grade will come from the Mid-Exams.
* 25% of the grade will come from the Final.
* 05% of the course grade will come from Attendance.
